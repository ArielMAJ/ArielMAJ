# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ArielMAJ

- I really enjoy studying and learning new things;
- I love working on solutions to problems and automations;
- I'm currently working as a **back-end developer** at SolfÃ¡cil;
- **Machine Learning** is part of my master's line of research;
- I also work with **React&Node**;

Make sure to take a look around my repos! I have contributed to a few open source projects and I also have some open source projects myself.
One I'm really proud of is [test.me](https://github.com/ArielMAJ/test.me).
It's really useful for testing code when studying Algorithms and Data Structures.
Feel free to try it out and contribute as well!
