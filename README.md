- 👋 Hi, I’m @ArielMAJ
- 👀 I’m interested in learning interesting tools and working on interesting things with them .
  - If they get too interesting my head explodes and the world rolls back. So... beware of trying to blow my mind or we may catch ourselves in an infinite loop 🔁.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying:
  - 👨‍💻 CS (🎓 master's degree);
  - Windows Forms with C#;
  - Web Development with HTML/CSS/JS;
  - 🐍 Deepening my knowledge of Data Science and Machine Learning with Python;
  - A few other things too.
- 💞️ I'm open to collaboration on my current repositories 🗂️, but I probably don't have the time ⏱️ for anything else 💔.


<!---
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects similar to the ones on my repositories.
